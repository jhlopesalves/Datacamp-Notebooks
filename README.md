A personal educational repository containing notebooks, datasets, exercises, and course materials from DataCamp, recreated for independent practice and review in Google Colab and other environments.

**My DataCamp Profile**: [jhlopesalves](https://www.datacamp.com/portfolio/jhlopesalves)

## Purpose

This repository serves as my personal learning hub where I:

- Recreate DataCamp exercises in a "real-world" environment
- Practice working with raw CSV, database, and dataset files
- Build skills without relying on DataCamp's abstracted environment
- Track my progress and maintain notes from various courses

## What's Included

- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks with course exercises and solutions
- **Datasets**: Raw data files (CSV, JSON, databases) used in exercises
- **Exercises**: Practice problems and coding challenges
- **Lectures**: Notes and code from course lectures
- **Challenges**: Additional practice problems and projects

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- Required libraries (see individual notebooks for specific requirements)

### Usage

1. Clone this repository
2. Open notebooks in your preferred environment (Jupyter, Colab, VS Code, etc.)
3. Download datasets as needed for each exercise
4. Follow along with the exercises and modify as desired
